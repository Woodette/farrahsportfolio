    <p>My husband and I love traveling together, mainly to warm destinations with beaches. One of our favorite trips was to Iceland. There was a lot of driving, but everywhere we went was breathtaking. We saw countless waterfalls and rainbows. Iceland is also known for its small, strong, and charming Icelandic horses.</p>
